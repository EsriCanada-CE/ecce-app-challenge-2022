I am a former gold medalist at the International Geography Olympiad, placing third worldwide in 2019. My areas of interest include geography education and digital humanities, and I enjoy applying my web development and web GIS skills to both of these areas. Some of my projects include www.geoworkshops.ca, a free repository of geography-related workshops and resources for high school students and teachers, and www.bayfieldhistoricalwebmap.ca, a digital atlas that showcases historical photographs, postcards, and maps from Bayfield Ontario.<br style="clear:both;" />

I am interested in human interactions with the environment and how infrastructure development impacts ecological systems, particularly effects of development on our water resources. I have work experience in environmental assessment and post-construction monitoring, which initially seeded my interest in these areas. When Iâ€™m not looking at maps, I listen to a lot of music.<br style="clear:both;" />

My interests involve using GIS to address social issues prevalent in the global landscape and geography education. Some of my projects include developing a lookup application for the City of Waterloo and working on the COVID-19 animation project for the UW Geospatial Club. In my free time I enjoy rock-climbing, watching tv with my family, and spending time with my dog.<br style="clear:both;" />
