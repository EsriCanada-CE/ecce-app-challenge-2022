## Background

In the era of climate change and global warming, we are seeing a higher frequency of natural disasters and increasing intensity of precipitation. London is situated in a relatively safe area, but we have identified several possible natural disasters including flooding, rainstorms, tornadoes, and snowstorms. Based on our research on existing data, we decided to create an app that is capable of demonstrating the impacts of flooding to the communities surrounding Medway Creek.


## Mission Statement & Goals

The main goal of our app is to demonstrate the impacts to the community surrounding Medway Creek in London, Ontario that would result from a severe weather event causing significant flooding to the river. While these flooding scenarios are very unlikely, being aware of the potential flood impacts in an extreme scenario is an important part of emergency preparedness. The app allows a user to select from different water level rise scenarios, and the app will display the area that would be covered by water on a map, as well as how much area would be covered in water and the number of properties that would be impacted in each scenario. With water rise levels ranging from 4.5 metres to 10 metres, the app shows a range of extreme scenarios. Hurricane Hazel in the Toronto area in 1954 caused river water levels to rise about 6 to 8 metres in some cases, so our app only demonstrates very unusual circumstances. This is a very rare case, but with climate change having an effect on future weather patterns, it is important to be aware of these extreme cases as they may become more likely to occur in the future.
Some other goals we are trying to acheieve are:
1. Integrating ArcGIS technology into natural disaster planning, and fostering a more sustaiable built-environment in London.
2. Increasing awareness regarding the risks of flooding and its potential impacts to the property owners located in the flood plain of Medway Creek and Thames River.
3. Provide an interactive platform for the non-GIS general public to visualize the magtitude of impacts resulted from water overflow from the river.
4. Identify and assess the risk of flooding in London, and understand hwo resilient is our university campus to flooding and whether it can withstand severe rainstorm events. 


## How to use the App

The app displays the area that would be covered by water with different amounts of water level increase to Medway Creek. App users can select a water level increase amount using the filter tool on the left, and this will change the flooded area shown on the map, and the total area covered by water shown on the bottom-left. The chart on the bottom-right shows how many properties in the study area would be impacted by different amounts of water level increase. There is also a link in the 'About' section to the Government of Canada website showing real-time water levels of Medway Creek.
