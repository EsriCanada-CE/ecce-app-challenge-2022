My interest's area in GIS is related to remote sensing, LiDAR technology, and spatial analysis of urban climate heat patterns. In the near future, I'm hoping to explore the possibilities of incorporating GIS technology into aviation operations and flight planning.<br style="clear:both;" />

This is my second year as a part of the ECCE team and second time participating in the app challenge. I love to use GIS to solve real world problems so this app challenge is right up my alley. I'm excited to see what all the teams come up with!<br style="clear:both;" />
