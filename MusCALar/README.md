**Description:**
The app allows users to conduct some simple spatial analysis, and recognise major populated places that are close to historical wildfire locations in Alberta.

**Introduction:**
There has been an increase in losses caused by natural disasters in Canada from the past 25 years, while flooding and wildfire being two most common disasters in Canada. The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimated the total insured losses in the event of natural disaster had reached 3 billion in 2016, while the loss was only around 50 million in 2000. Seven out of ten costliest disasters are recorded in Alberta. The costliest wildfire, Fort McMurray wildfire in 2016, has an estimated loss of 3.82 billion. Wildfire can bring huge casualties and property losses if left unattended or mistreated.

MusCALar intends to provide general public with a general understanding of the risk of wildfire in Alberta. Residents of different populated places in Alberta will be able to assess the risk of wildfire by looking at the historical extent of wildfire nearby. App users can also estimate the distance of their locations to sites of wildfire. Government can also prioritize resources to areas that are more prone to wildfire. 

**Prerequisites:**
By clicking the app link, the app could be launched in any devices including desktop, phone and tablets. No installation is required.

**How to use?**
After launching the app, there is a searching bar on the top left hand corner, users could search the desired places. Other than searching, users could also locate their live positions by using the tool on the right hand side. Tools such as measurement and share information are also available. At the right bottom corner, users could view the detailed information of different layers by using the attribute table.

**_Wildfire in Alberta_**
Our team has selected wildfires with burn class 5 and fire class E for easier understanding as these wildfires are the most serious and affecting most of the community. Wildfires are shown in yellow to red gradual colors which allows users to define the scale of wildfire at first glance. Users could click on the area polygon to check its size of affected area, year of occurence and source of data. This part of data allows users to understand the location of wildfires happened in the past 50 years.

**_Proximity to wildfire_**
Apart from allowing users to understand the information of past wildfires, our team also provides the proximity to wildfire for users, to see if their desired or existing living places are close to the historical wildfire. We have imported all populated regions in Alberta, 3 classes are developed based on the calculated distance, gradual colors are used for determining the closeness to the wildfire region. Government can also prioritize resources to areas that are more prone to wildfire.
