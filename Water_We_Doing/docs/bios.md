I am majoring in physical geography, with minors in biology and sociology. GIS and remote-sensing courses have been my favourites during my studies, so I am excited to learn more and develop my skills in this challenge! In my spare time, I dabble in graphic design, writing, and literature. I also spend hours poring over old and new maps, discovering what has been discovered before. I hope to one day contribute some of my own knowledge to future cartophiles.<br style="clear:both;" />

Cruz**: I am a fourth-year undergraduate student double-majoring in GIS and Human Geography. Throughout university, I have thoroughly developed my love for GIS and learning about the relationships between place and space. After my undergrad, I aspire to obtain a Masters in Urban Planning and one day become a professional planner.<br style="clear:both;" />

My passion for teaching and computers has led me to love GIS because of the opportunity to transform data and delight viewers by weaving meaningful stories. I am in my 4th year at University of Toronto Mississauga studying GIS, Communication Technology, and Computer Science.<br style="clear:both;" />
