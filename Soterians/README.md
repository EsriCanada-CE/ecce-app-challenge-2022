### Our Mission is to give everyone access to reliable and real-time information in the event of a major emergency.
During a major emergency, uncertainty and distress may lead to uninformed and dangerous decisions. People’s preparedness levels may also vary depending on the nature of the emergency. 

Soteria is designed to work with emergency response units, law enforcement, and the government to provide real-time critical information to those in the affected area as well as to those who have family or friends there. This application also allows people in the area to add relevant information for the community. Crowdsourcing leverages the community to provide a direct impact while easing the burden of emergency response services.

The current war in Ukraine is an example of why creating this application is so important. One of our team is from Ukraine with many friends and family members there. Each person has expressed the lack of reliable information and the ability to share and receive information from others around them.

### Features

##### 1. Official guide to prepare for major emergencies
Emergency guides are everywhere on the website. With Soteria, you will have access to the local and national guides in case of emergencies, with relevant information on the things you are recommended to do before, during and after any major emergency. This information is always available in the app with just one click on the “Recommendations” button  

##### 2. Real time location of relatives/friends
In case of emergencies, it is good to know where your loved ones are all the time without necessarily talking to them. The Soteria app connects you to the people you care about, so you can know where they are all the time. Before you can see your family and friends’ live location, you need to send a request to add them, using the “Add Member for sharing location”   and clicking “Add Another Member". That will send you to an ArcGIS Survey 123 registration form. You will need your ArcGIS username and the information of the member you want to add. Name, last name, phone number and email. Once you’re done, submit the form and you can add another member or close the window. This information will be received by the Soteria team and it will be reviewed. The members you want to share your location with will get an ArcGIS account with a temporary password through their email. They need to download the ArcGIS Workforce app on their phones and log in. They need to select the map that was created for them. In the to-do list, they need to select the option available and click start. They can share a picture, video or voice note whenever they want. After starting the live location, click on the sync option   and then “Sync Now”. In the app, you will see their location and they will see yours. You can update your status by clicking on the "Status Button"   and selecting working for showing that you are online. On break for showing that you paused and not working for connection problems. We recommend you to keep the online status all the time when an emergency is taking place. This information will be shown in the Soteria app. If you want to stop sharing your location, click on the to-do list, “Live Location” and select “Finish”.

##### 3. Geolocated Tweets
Information is very important in case of emergencies and social media can help a lot, but it can help you more if you can see the posts around you and the emergency area. Remember to always confirm any information with the official accounts and news first. The Soteria app uses a Twitter API to find the Tweets around you. If you want to go to a place, make sure you read the Tweets around that place to know what’s going on and if it’s safe to go there. You will be able to see the Tweet and if you want to go to the account, click on “More info”. That will take you out of the app and send you to the Twitter app. You can also access the official Twitter account of your local government by clicking on the "Official Information Button"   to see the most recent updates about the emergency.

##### 4. Dynamic Street view cameras
In case of emergencies, you want to know what’s happening around you and the whole area. Street cameras are spread over the cities and you can have access to them in many different ways. The Soteria app will connect you to the Windy webcams, which show the latest images of the webcam selected. All you have to do is click on the camera you want to see  , click on “More Info” and you will be redirected to the windy website. You can play the video and see the nearest cameras to that one selected that are available.

##### 5. Crowdsource information / threats
Information is everywhere nowadays and the Soteria app is not the exception. You will be able to see information posted by other users of the app regarding the situation. In case of emergencies, products and services can be affected and most of the time you can’t find updated information about their availability. For example, grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations. It is important to know if they have their products and services available before taking the risks of going out. Users of Soteria can inform others about the availability or not of a product and service or general information on points of interest. If you want to add a report, go to the “Report An Event”   button and click on “REPORT AN EVENT”. You will be sent to the ArcGIS Survey 123 form. Click on the map. The map will automatically show your location. You can keep the point in this location or move it to the point of interest. You can also find an address or a place using the search bar. Once you selected the exact point, select the date and time. Select the event type. Available products or services, or not, or general information. You can leave a comment if you want, so other users will have more information about the point reported. After you’re done, submit the form. You can add another report or close the window.
You can also add threats, so you keep other users away from them. Click on the “Threat” button  . Select the draw mode. Either a point, a line or an area. Select the threat type. They can go from car accidents to explosions, fires and even shootings. They have predefined distances and descriptions. Once you selected all the options, click or draw on the map. Once you confirm the location, click on “Create Zones” and then click “Publish”. Your feature will be shown automatically and will affect other users' routing decisions, so use this feature with responsibility. Others will be able to recommend deleting this threat if they consider it fake or misinformative.

##### 6. Reporting misinformation
Misinformation is part of everyday life, but it is crucial in case of emergencies. If you noticed fake information or information that has to be updated, you can report it. Click on the “Report Misinformation” button  . You can select an element or draw an area on the layers available. If you want to report a threat that is fake or in the wrong place, select the Threats layer. Click the threat on the map and fill in the details form that will show up. You will need to specify the review status. Either you want to add another feature, delete one, move it or reshape it. You can add some notes of the reasons and select the severity of this change you want to make, being 5 the most severe one. The layer won't update automatically. The Soteria team will receive the report and confirm the information with the official authorities to update the feature. In that way, we keep misinformation away and the users safe.

##### 7. Reliable routing
  Get the directions from one point to another. You can select the point that you want to go to and the one that you want to start from, or you can select the points on the map. You will see the directions in real-time that it will take you to get to your destination and the distance. You can add another point, select the different modes available, change the units, return to the origin after the trip and select the date and time you want to leave.  You can also save the directions to your account or print them and add some notes. Remember to click “Get Directions” to update the route and click clear to start a new trip.
If you want to start a trip and there’s a reported threat along the route, the app will automatically select another route to avoid that threat and take you to your destination safe and sound.

##### 8. Dynamic traffic incidents
Traffic is important for every aspect of our lives. But it is more important in case of emergencies. Soteria app uses the World Traffic Service map by ArcGIS to show the location of accidents, construction, closures and other issues that could potentially impact the flow of traffic. This information will provide context for routing, navigation and field operations. This information is updated every five minutes and it’s from reliable sources. Not all of them are critical to changing your route, so before you start a trip, make sure you identify these incidents in your route.
