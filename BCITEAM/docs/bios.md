After taking an intro to GIS course in Langara he became interested to learn more about GIS and decided to continue his interest and pursue a degree in GIS. He is now studying at the British Columbia Institute of Technology in the Geographic Information Systems program. Some GIS projects he has done are finding vehicular related crime activity around the city of Vancouver, as well as, a project finding optimal locations for artillery to aid avalanche controls in Rogers Pass, BC during Op PALACI with the Canadian Armed Forces. He is excited to bring his GIS skills to any problem he encounters.<br style="clear:both;" />
