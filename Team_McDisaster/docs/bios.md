I am on a track to attain a Certified GIS Professional (GISP) accreditation, by which I plan on carrying out my interest in GIS with my passion for epidemiology. Currently, I am working on a Senior Thesis that involves the use of ArcGIS Pro and ArcPy, to study the association between automobile emissions in terms of fine particulate matter and inhalation intake throughout various routes in Hamilton, Ontario. My hobbies include walking to Starbucks while listening to true crime podcasts and playing APEX Legends.<br style="clear:both;" />

I also did my undergrad and a concurrent GIS Certificate at McMaster, where I did my thesis on the sedimentation and ichnology of TÅ«ranganui-a-Kiwa Bay in New Zealand. My current research involves using drone imagery and measured sections to characterize the stratigraphy and facies architecture of the Dunvegan Aquifer in the Liard Basin, Northwest Territories to mitigate hydrocarbon contamination risk caused by nearby fracking developments. Outside of academics, I love taking care of my plant jungle, raising my two baby hamsters, crocheting, and hiking.<br style="clear:both;" />

My senior thesis project focuses on respiratory health determinants in Hamilton, Ontario. Outside of school, I can be found reading obscure Wikipedia pages, drinking herbal tea, and playing with my two cats (Lucifer and Felix).<br style="clear:both;" />
