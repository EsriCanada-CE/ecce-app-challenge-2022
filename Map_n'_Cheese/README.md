# ResponsePlan Web-App by Map n' Cheese

The ResponsePlan app is a web application which informs people in Nova Scotia of the nearest emergency services during an emergency. The app also lets people report incident locations and allows people to share with others any aid and resources they are offering to the other members of their community.

## Mission Statement

Sometimes, being prepared for an emergency is as simple as knowing what's around you. If you're at home during a natural disaster, you likely know of nearby places to find help, seek shelter, and stay safe. But what if you're not at home when disaster strikes? How will you find the nearby Police or Fire stations? How can you stay informed of local hazards, or people offering help nearby? What if you’d like to report a hazard, or want to offer aid to your community? How can this information be conveyed to people in a spatial context? And how can you, and others, access it? 
 
The ResponsePlan app seeks to answer these questions. ResponsePlan is a surveying, archiving, and route-finding software that allows you to stay informed of nearby hazards, local/government infrastructure, and private citizens that are personally offering aid. In addition, it allows you to place map pins to identify nearby dangers or broadcast your location to other users if you want to offer food, water, or other forms of assistance. 
 
We believe having ResponsePlan installed on your device can help prepare you for any disaster scenario. The ability to spatially visualize hazards as they’re updated in real-time, plot navigation routes to hospitals, places of refuge, or locally offered aid, and inform others of potential dangers or your support is an invaluable framework for information flow and is one that can only truly be established before disaster strikes. The data provided by this application can be used for both civilian and government decision-making, with the former gaining easy access to literature that can increase survival odds in disaster scenarios. Finally, using ResponsePlan has the potential to keep you and others informed while also directing traffic away from services like Google Maps or Emergency service lines, so those who are less prepared may find easier access to these services. 


## Web App Description

Launching ResponsePlan opens a map of Nova Scotia containing roads and critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, police stations, and places of refuge. On the left panel is a prompt to either enter your address or use “Device Location” to pinpoint your position on the map. Once your location is known, you can begin querying the app for navigation routes to places of interest within a specified radius of your person. In this way, users can visualize all the relevant emergency options around them - hospitals, fire stations, community centers, etc.- without having to make multiple individual queries through applications such as Google Maps. Potentially, this can aid in decision-making during disaster scenarios- where every second counts. 
As time goes on during a crisis, the map will begin to get populated with additional pins denoting local hazards or offerings of help. This is the secondary function of ResponsePlan, which provides users the ability to place and update “Aid” or “Hazard” pins using ArcGIS’s Survey123. These surveys are accessed via direct link or in the About Widget.

### Hazard Reporter Form

The Hazard Reporter form is for people to report incidents and hazards in Nova Scotia to help keep their fellow community members informed on nearby emergencies. There are nine different hazards which people can report: flooding, fire, road washout, vehicle wreck, chemical spill, debris field, downed power line, damaged building, and dangerous animal sighting. Users can then search for an address or place a pin on the map to report the location of the hazard. The user can also add a photo and any other details that they think would be important for others to know. After submitting a hazard, people have the ability to make changes to their entry and mark the hazard as unresolve or resolved. Once the location is recorded, the hazard geopoint will remain on the map for seven days, or until it is marked as resolved.

### Community Helper Form

The Community Helper form allows people to let others know of any aid they can provide to people in need of assistance. The form gives users the option of 9 different types of assistance: Food, Fresh Water, Electricity, Entertainment, Debris Cleanup, Snow Removal, Working kitchen facilities, Fire/warmth, and shelter. The user will then enter the address where they are offering the assistance, and any images and details they wish to include. After submission people will be able to make changes to their entry, and the geopoint will remain on the map for twenty-four hours.

### About Widget

The About widget contains information about what the app does and how to use it. This widget lets people know about what services they can search for, and how to access the surveys and how to use them. This section also informs people that if they need immediate emergency assistance, to call 911 or the appropriate local authorities. The Emergency Preparation tab includes links which people can use to find information about disaster planning and preparedness. The Hazard Count tab shows a count of the total hazards which are currently on the map. 

### Hazard Types Widget

The Hazard Types tab provides a breakdown of the different types of hazards which are currently on the map. The Community Helper tab shows which types of community aid are being offered. These widgets update as people submit the forms.
