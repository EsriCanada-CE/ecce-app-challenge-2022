Her research involves understanding the application of side scan sonar to detect abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear in benthic environments. During her undergraduate degree in urban planning and design, she gained a strong interest in landscape-level planning, structural connectivity, and conservation GIS. Combining both interests, her current work includes various projects with organizations such as Coastal Action, Dalhousie University, Parks Canada, and Ontario Parks. This is Leah’s third app challenge! Outside of school, she can be found trail running, walking her dog Echo, searching for the tastiest stout, or cooking up a storm.<br style="clear:both;" />
