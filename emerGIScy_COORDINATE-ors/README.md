# Mission Statement
The mission of the Disaster Response applications is for government organizations to provide real-time information on disasters and emergencies, as well as potential hazards, to citizens. Disaster Response is designed for citizens to receive mobile notifications based on their proximity to events so they can adequately prepare, as well as browse potential threats in their area. A design philosophy emphasizing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate UI was embraced during design and development. Our application currently covers only Metro Vancouver due to resource and time constraints of the app challenge, but expanding our coverage to all of Canada would be the logical next step. 

The Disaster Response applications align with the theme of this year's ESRI Canada Centers of Excellence (ECCE) App Challenge â€“ Natural Disasters and Emergency Preparedness, alongside the sub-themes of Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure.

# App Description
The Disaster Response applications include a web application, D.R. Dispatch, for organizations to map disaster areas and related resources, and then push this information down to citizens, and a native mobile app, D.R. Aware, for citizens to consume the information on their smartphones.

The applications, described in detail below, aim to: 

1. Effectively alert citizens of emergency situations and resources in their area
2. Allow citizens to receive updated information from government officials as events unfold
3. Inform citizens of potential threats in their area to enable personal decision making and preparedness

## DR Dispatch
D.R. Dispatch is a Web Application built using ESRI's App Builder and was created for government officials to inform citizens of emergencies and disasters.
