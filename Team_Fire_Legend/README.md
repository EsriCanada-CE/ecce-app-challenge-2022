### Mission Statement

As we head towards the future, it is inevitable that our society will face serious natural disaster emergencies. These disasters can range from earthquakes, floods, forest fires and tsunamis. Although we cannot prevent natural disasters from happening, we can mitigate the impacts through preparation and using the proper response steps. 

Proper emergency preparation for disaster events is a life-or-death matter. Preparation creates greater opportunities to survive in disaster events but not all preparation methods are the same. Preparing for an earthquake is not the same as preparing for a flood and response plans used in tsunamis will differ then those used in wildfires. It is important to know different preparation methods and plans to be properly ready for all disaster situations.

The goal of the EmergenBC Hub is to create a hub that consolidates disaster response and preparation information for the public while also acting as a pseudo-rescue app to aid the efforts of first responders during disaster times. The EmergenBC Hub directs users and viewers to available resources listed by the British Columbia provincial government and showcases disaster efforts and resources created by their local municipal government as well. In addition, the app provides an emergency response form for users to indicate their status after a natural disaster has happened and their status is then updated to a live map to help aid rescue efforts or to inform family and friends.

### Using EmergenBC Hub

**Home Page**

The home page provides basic information about the landscape of British Columbia. It showcases the different properties of the province and provides context to the types of natural disasters that can happen here. Users can interact with the web maps on the home page and can view data about earthquakes, tsunami zones and wildfires in British Columbia.


**Prepare Page**

The prepare page goes into how the user can prepare for a natural disaster emergency. It provides links to different provincial government resources for disaster management and disaster emergencies. This page also features links to municipal emergency preparedness webpages that have resources available for different types of emergencies for the user to obtain. Alongside the resources, there are two webapps that showcase available data from different municipal governments regarding disaster preparation. The first app shows locations of Vancouver Disaster Support Hubs and features a distance widget, which will let the user calculate their distance to any one of the support hubs. The second app is a simple web map that displays the Victoria tsunami safe and hazard zone data, taken from the City of VictoriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s open database.

**Response Page**

The response page guides the users with appropriate ways to respond during a sudden disaster psychologically and physically. This page contains two practical applications which the users can use when a disaster happens. The first app is a Disaster Response Survey, which helps the users submit their status and contact information during a disaster. The second app is a web application that maps out the submitted forms from the survey, based on the information submitted. Upon submission of the survey, the SurveyMap will place the status, location and other details into a point on the map based on the location. The map page will need to be refreshed after to display the newly inputted point. The SurveyMap also features filtering and measuring functions that can help the users check on their family, friends and neighbours, and provide information to rescuers to prioritize their rescue missions.
