# Safer Space
### Description
Safer Space is an application that showcases the distribution of Indigenous population across Canada and the impact of wildfires that their communities have been subject to in 2020. Additionally, the application also shows currently active forest fires which updates every three hours. Through Safer Space, we aim to highlight the direct impact of natural disasters on Indigenous communities to show the vulnerable state the communities are currently in or have endured. Finally, we provide the means for users to directly donate whatever the Indigenous communities require the most through certified funding sources. Therefore, each individual can take part in creating a safer space for all.

### Mission Statement

Every year, approximately 8,000 wildfires occur across Canada, devastating communities and removing people from their homes. While wildfires affect everyone, they are particularly devastating towards Indiegnous Communities. They are often not well connected to government resources and often face discrimination. Additionally, Indeignous communities tend to be of lower-income population, making them particularly vulnerable to natural hazards. Bringing attention to wildfire effects on Indigenous communities, will help alleviate this vulnerability through certified sources of funding and donations.
Safer Space will help users understand the impact of fires on Indigenous Territories across Canada, document potential hazardous material based on the type of spill and location on the map.


### Description of Application Features:

  

### The Legend: 
this will show you the main layers on this map.

The first one layer will showcase Legislative boundaries of Indigenous Lands of Canada, as defined by the Government of Canada. This includes legislative boundaries of Indian Reserves, and Land Claim Settlement Lands. (lands created under Comprehensive Land Claims Process that do not or will not have Indian Reserve status under the Indian Act) and Indian Lands.

The second layer shows the type of fires that occurred during the year 2020. We wanted to showcase this year as it is the most up to data comparable data that we currently have. It provides more information about the type of fire that occurred in specific provinces.

The last layer displays data on the active wildfire locations which collected every 3 hours from fire management agencies (provinces, territories, and Parks Canada) in Canada.

If you go to map and click on any point you will be able to see the active fires data which includes attributes for agency, fire name, start date, and stage of its control. The reported active fire locations are updated daily as provided by fire management agencies (provinces, territories and Parks Canada). The wildfires data is managed through a national Data Integration Project (DIP) coordinated by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) and Natural Resources Canada with participation from all partner agencies. This initiative focuses on the development and implementation of data standards and enabling the exchange and access of national fire data. More details are available in the CIFFC IM/IT Strategy, available at: [https://ciffc.ca/publications/general-publications](https://ciffc.ca/publications/general-publications).

The active fires data includes attributes for agency, fire name, latitude, longitude, start date, fire size (ha) and stage of control (fire status). The 3 stages of control included:

Out of Control (OC) - Being Held (BH) - Under Control (UC)

From all of these layers combined you will be able to understand better if certain wildfires are directly impacting indigenous communities.

### Layer List Feature: 
The layer list on our application is also a very important widget. You can get a different view of the map by removing various layers or zooming to specific ones on the map. You can also view the attribute table to get more information on the layers as well.

### The Emergency Response Guide Widget: 
This allows users to determine potential hazards based on the material, spill size, and spill location on the map. By selecting a specific location by using the pin that automatically determines the users coordinates of their location. Then, they can specify the possible source of the fire such as oil, compounds, etc. Users can also include the size of the spill and choose to turn on the Fire Isolation Zone. They can also include information on the wind direction or time of the spill if they have the knowledge of it and then create the zone. After creating a Zone, Users will know whether or not there are any protective action distances as well as isolation and evacuation zones near that area, if any. Thus Accordingly, They can further know which sources are available to reach out for help.

  

### Donate Link Button:

Through this button, users are able to access a certified donations website, in which they can directly help indigenous communities that are impacted by wild fires across the nation.
