## Mission Statement

Flooding occurs when a body of water takes on more volume than what it typically confines, leading to the excess being redirected over the surrounding landscape. In Nova Scotia, flooding typically occurs after extreme precipitation events, melting of snow pack, river ice jams, tidal events, and storm surge brought on by meteorological events. While flooding is a natural phenomenon in Nova Scotia, flooding becomes an issue when it damages property, infrastructure, or negatively impacts human lives.

Floods are the most commonly occurring natural disaster in Canada and pose a threat to critical infrastructure, properties, and in extreme cases, can even put lives at risk (PSC, 2021). Nova Scotia is vulnerable to both inland and coastal flooding events, both of which are increasing in frequency and severity as a result of climate change (Warren & Lemmen, 2014). Sea level rise will further exacerbate effects on coastal communities, which comprise 70% of Nova Scotiaâ€™s population (Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2009).

## Our Goal

The goal of the Spatial Cluster Application is to inform its viewers of issues surrounding flood disasters within the province of Nova Scotia. The application provides details surrounding historic events, the associated risks involved with floods, elements to assist in flood prediction, and finally, provides the user with important information on how to prepare in the case of emergency and what to do in the aftermath of a flood. 

## How to use the App

The app is designed to be an interactive interface that informs the user on how to deal with flood events. Navigating the application is as easy as exploring a website and is configured to read as a story, first informing the reader of the issues surrounding floods, why they are of concern, and what they can do to prepare. As the reader scrolls through the application, they are met with several interactive pieces of multimedia that are intuitive to employ. There are links provided throughout providing additional documentation and points the reader towards alterative resources provided by government bodies.
