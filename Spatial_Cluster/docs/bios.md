My research aims to identify factors that may be contributing to water quality changes in Halifax-area lakes. I also belong to the Aquatic Systems Professional and Industrial training for the Restoration Economy (ASPIRE) program at Dalhousie. Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my BSc with Honours in Environmental Science at Mount Allison University, where I also worked as a research technician in the Environmental Change and Aquatic Biomonitoring (ECAB) Lab and contributed to microfiber and microplastic research.<br style="clear:both;" />

Originally, I was introduced to GIS because someone was offering free pizza as a part of a one day crash course. Over 10 years later, I'm still hooked, using GIS in both educational and professional settings, though I still won't say no to free pizza.<br style="clear:both;" />

My current academic goals include completing my undergraduate degree with Dalhousie’s certificate in GIS, and am planning out my route towards a Masters. When not studying, I am on nature walks or browsing through local record shops.<br style="clear:both;" />
